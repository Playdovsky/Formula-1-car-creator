# Formula-car-creator
## Project premise
Formula car creator allows user to create desired race car.
Each car made by user is then added into garage from which cars can be converted into one of the three states - damaged, show and race (by default).
This application is made primarily to extend knowledge and practice principals of object oriented programming - encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
